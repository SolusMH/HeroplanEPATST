# Heroplan Hero Database 🐉

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **Heroplan Hero Database**! This is an all-in-one, multi-functional information platform designed for players of *Empires & Puzzles*. It provides an intuitive, static HTML interface to help you quickly browse, search, and filter heroes, and integrates practical guides for wanted missions and farming locations.

Whether you're looking for a specific hero or need to find the best stage to farm materials, this tool has you covered. No complex backend setup is required—all you need is a web browser.

This project is powered by data from [Heroplan.io](https://heroplan.io/). A huge thank you to the E&P community for their continuous updates to hero data! The enhanced Chinese version is crafted by Juno, aiming to provide a more user-friendly experience for Chinese-speaking players.
